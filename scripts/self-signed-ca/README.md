This self-signed-ca folder contains scripts for creating ssl certificates.

You can run `create-all.sh localhost` manually, or by running one of the following files from the project root folder:
- `make certs` - creates certificates if they don't already exist
- `make certs-new` - forces creation of new certificates
 

Look at `create-all.sh` first if you want to understand how it all works.
